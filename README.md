# Covid-19-Prediction

## 1.Requirements
keras==2.2.0

tensorflow==1.3.1

numpy, matplotlib will be metter if they are the newest

## 2.Usage
This is a competition in my college to predict the number of everyday new 
diagnosis in China, Italy and UK.

Everyday data comes from <https://dxy.com/>.

## 3.Statement
This problem was the first case where I used
machine learning method. What I wrote was simply
based on neural networks, with some trials on
activiation function.
So there are many small problems and no tricks and dummy
way in this project such as overfitted and deviation on
the prediction of future numbers. But a good start is a half done.
In the long way, this competition will be definitely ubforgettable.
